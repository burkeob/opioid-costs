"Statistic is not reported because the reporting cell draws from fewer than two hospitals, contains fewer than 11 discharges, has a relative standard error (standard error / weighted estimate) greater than 0.30 or equal to 0, or because the county is missing 2% or more of total discharges in the HCUP State Inpatient Database (SID) when compared to the Medicare Hospital Service Area File.",,,,,,,,,
"Statistics for age, sex, and expected payer type cannot be calculated because population estimates are not available for missing categories of age or sex and because population insurance coverage information is not available at the county- or region-level.",,,,,,,,,
"Community-level statistics are from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), State Inpatient Databases (SID), based on data collected by individual States and provided to AHRQ by State Partners. Weighted national estimates are from the HCUP National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS).",,,,,,,,,
"Rates of discharges are calculated using HCUP inpatient data as numerators and Claritas county population estimates as denominators, except for the rate of maternal/neonatal stays, which uses the number of inpatient deliveries as the denominator.",,,,,,,,,

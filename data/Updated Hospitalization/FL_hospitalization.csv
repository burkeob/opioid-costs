"Statistic is not reported because the reporting cell draws from fewer than two hospitals, contains fewer than 11 discharges, has a relative standard error (standard error / weighted estimate) greater than 0.30 or equal to 0, or because the county is missing 2% or more of total discharges in the HCUP State Inpatient Database (SID) when compared to the Medicare Hospital Service Area File.",,,,,,,,,,
"Statistics for age, sex, and expected payer type cannot be calculated because population estimates are not available for missing categories of age or sex and because population insurance coverage information is not available at the county- or region-level.",,,,,,,,,,

Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Unreliable."
"2. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
